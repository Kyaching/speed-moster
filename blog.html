            Q.2: What is the difference between arrow function vs regular

                    The first and most obvious difference between arrow
                    functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do
                    they look different, but arrow functions also provide an
                    implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around a
                    single argument to be omitted.
                  </td>

                  <td>
                    Inside a regular function, execution context (i.e. the value
                    of this) is dynamic. This means that the value of this
                    depends on how the function was invoked (simple invocation,
                    method invocation, indirect invocation or constructor
                    invocation). On the other hand, an arrow function does not
                    define its own execution context. This results in an arrow
                    function's this being resolved lexically (i.e. the scope in
                    which the arrow function was defined).

                  <th scope="row">3</th>
                  <td>
                    Function.prototype.call(), Function.prototype.bind() and
                    Function.prototype.apply() do not work correctly with arrow
                    functions either. Their purpose is to allow methods to
                    execute within different scopes, but the this value of an
                    arrow function cannot be changed, as it's resolved
                    lexically.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th scope="row">4</th>
                  <td>
                    Due to arrow functions not defining their own execution
                    context, they're not well-suited for usage as methods.
                    However, thanks to the Class fields proposal, arrow
                    functions can be used as methods inside classes, if your
                    environment supports it.
