                    A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable
                    is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it
                    exists in the global scope. The global variables can be
                    accessed by any line of code in the program, including
                    inside blocks.

                    In contrast to global variables, locally scoped ones are
                    only visible within the function they are declared. Each
                    function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and
                    every variable declared in this scope is a local variable.
                    That means that variables with the same name can be used in
                    different functions. However, any effort to reference a
                    local variable outside its scope will result in a Reference

                    Event Loop : The event loop is the secret behind
                    JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                    operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data
                    structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

                    The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call
                    Stack and the Callback Queue or Message Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
                    Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
                    effectively runs it.Such an iteration is called a tick in
                    the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.
